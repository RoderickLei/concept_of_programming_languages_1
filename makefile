# However, sometimes you want your Makefile to run commands that do not 
# represent physical files in the file system. Good examples for this are the 
# common targets "clean" and "all". Chances are this isn't the case, but you 
# may potentially have a file named clean in your main directory. In such a case 
# Make will be confused because by default the clean target would be associated 
# with this file and Make will only run it when the file doesn't appear to be 
# up-to-date with regards to its dependencies.
#
# These special targets are called phony and you can explicitly tell Make 
# they're not associated with files
.PHONY: all clean debug release

# The biggest difference between these is that:
# In a debug build the complete symbolic debug information is emitted to help 
# while debugging applications and also the code optimization is not taken into 
# account.
#
# While in release build the symbolic debug info is not emitted and the code 
# execution is optimized.
#
# Also, because the symbolic info is not emitted in a release build, the size of 
# the final executable is lesser than a debug executable.
